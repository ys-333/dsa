### Self balancing Bianry Search Tree.

## Here we are discussing about AVL tree.

## There are four types of unbalanced, occur,

# Right Right(RR)

# Left Left(LL)

# Right left (RL)

# Left Right (LR)

# RR - >In this type of unbalanced, we rotate the tree counter clockwise

# direction, or left Rotation.

# LL - >In this type of unbalanced, we rotate the tree clockwise direction, or right Rotation to ensure that height remain O(logn)

# RL ->In this type of unbalanced, we do two rotation.

# 1) We make it right right by right rotation or clockwise rotation

# 2) Then do left rotation or counter clockwise rotation.

### Balacing Factor = |lh-rh| where lh->left height, rh->right height.It should always be less than equal to 1. If so that marks that tree is unbalanced.

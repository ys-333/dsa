## If graph is un-weighted and we need to find shortest path ---> BFS traversal. Time Complexity(O(V+E))

## If graph is weighted Directed and acyclic and we have to find shortest path---> Topological Sort. Time Complexity (O(V+E)).

## If graph is weighted, directed or undirected cyclic or acylic and we have to find shortest path -----> Dijikshtra algorithm. Time Complexity (O(Elog(E)+O(V)+))
